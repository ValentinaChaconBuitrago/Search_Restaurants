This application has API REST to connect to a MongoDB obtaining restaurants and their details. 
## Application deployment
This application has both a front and back end, which means that it is necessary to have a certain setup in order to use it. 
### Requirements
#### Node.js
If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
#### MongoDB 
If you're storing your data locally, install Mongo following the instructions [here](https://www.mongodb.com/en).
Once you have installed Mongo, run the following command in your terminal:

```
mongodb
```
In case you are using Mongo Atlas and your data is stored in the cloud, whitelist your IP address and create a new data base user. More details on how to configure this set up [here](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/driver-connection/).
